# TrueNAS Websocket Client

*Found an issue? Please report it on our [Jira bugtracker](https://jira.ixsystems.com).*

## About

The TrueNAS websocket client provides the command line tool `midclt` and the means to easily communicate with [middleware](https://github.com/truenas/middleware) using Python by making calls through the [websocket API](https://www.truenas.com/docs/api/scale_websocket_api.html). The client can connect to a local TrueNAS instance by default or to a specified remote socket. This offers an alternative to going through the [web UI](https://github.com/truenas/webui) or connecting via ssh.

By default, communication facilitated by the API between the client and middleware now uses the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol. However, it is still possible to use the legacy client by passing a legacy uri, e.g. `'ws://some.truenas.address/websocket'` as opposed to `'ws://some.truenas.address/api/current'`.

## Getting Started

TrueNAS comes with this client preinstalled, but it is also possible to use the TrueNAS websocket client from a non-TrueNAS host.

On a non-TrueNAS host, ensure that Git is installed and run `pip install git+https://github.com/truenas/api_client.git` to automatically install dependencies. You may alternatively clone this repository and run `python setup.py install`. Using a Python venv is recommended.

## Usage

The `midclt` command (not to be confused with the [TrueNAS CLI](https://github.com/truenas/midcli)) provides a way to make direct API calls through the client. To view its syntax, enter `midclt -h`. The `-h` option can also be used with any of `midclt`'s subcommands.

The client's default behavior is to connect to the localhost's middlewared socket. For a remote connection, e.g. from a Windows host, you must specify the `--uri` option and authenticate with either user credentials or an API key. For example: `midclt --uri ws://<TRUENAS_IP>/api/current -K key ...`

### Make local API calls

```
root@my_truenas[~]# midclt call user.create '{"full_name": "John Doe", "username": "user", "password": "pass", "group_create": true}'
```

### Login to a remote TrueNAS

```
root@my_truenas[~]# midclt --uri ws://some.other.truenas/api/current -U user -P password call system.info
```

### Start a job

```
root@my_truenas[~]# midclt call -j pool.dataset.lock mypool/mydataset
```

## Development

The TrueNAS API client can also be used in Python scripts.

### Make local API calls

```python
from truenas_api_client import Client

with Client() as c:  # Local IPC
      print(c.ping())  # pong
      user = {"full_name": "John Doe", "username": "user", "password": "pass", "group_create": True}
      entry_id = c.call("user.create", user)
      user = c.call("user.get_instance", entry_id)
      print(user["full_name"])  # John Doe
```

### Login with a user account or an API key

```python
# User account
with Client(uri="ws://some.other.truenas/api/current") as c:
      c.call("auth.login", username, password)

# API key
with Client(uri="ws://some.other.truenas/api/current") as c:
      c.call("auth.login_with_api_key", key)
```

### Start a job

```python
with Client() as c:
      is_locked = c.call("pool.dataset.lock", "mypool/mydataset", job=True)
      if is_locked:
            args = {"datasets": [{"name": "mypool/mydataset", "passphrase": "passphrase"}]}
            c.call("pool.dataset.unlock", "mypool/mydataset", args, job=True)
```
